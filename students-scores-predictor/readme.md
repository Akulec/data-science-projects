# Student Score Prediction

A beginner-friendly machine learning project that uses **Simple Linear Regression** to predict a studentâ€™s score based on study hours. Ideal for those new to data science and Python.



##  Problem Statement

> Can we accurately predict how well a student will perform in an exam based on the number of hours studied?

This is a regression problem where the goal is to model the relationship between study time and performance.



##  Dataset

- **Source:** Synthetic / small open dataset  
- **Columns:**
  - `Hours`: Time spent studying
  - `Scores`: Exam percentage score



##  Technologies & Libraries

| Language | Tools & Libraries |
|----------|-------------------|
| Python   | `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `jupyter` |
