#  Student Score Prediction

This project uses **Simple Linear Regression** to predict a student’s score based on the number of hours studied. It’s perfect for beginners looking to learn core machine learning and data science techniques.



## Problem Statement

> "Can we predict student performance (exam score) from the number of study hours?"



## Dataset

- Source: [Simple dataset from Kaggle (or manually created)]  
- Columns:
  - Hours: Number of hours studied
  - Scores`: Percentage score obtained



##  Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.9.0
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn



##  What I Learned

- Data loading and exploration
- Visualizing relationships (scatter plots)
- Applying linear regression using scikit-learn
- Splitting data into training and test sets
- Evaluating with MAE, MSE, and R² score
- Making predictions from new inputs
